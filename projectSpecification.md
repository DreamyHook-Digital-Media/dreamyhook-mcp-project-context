# Project Context MCP Server - Complete Project Specification

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
The Project Context MCP Server transforms how Claude Code understands and interacts with software projects by providing intelligent, automatic project context gathering through the Model Context Protocol. This tool eliminates the manual overhead of explaining project structure, dependencies, and recent changes to Claude Code, enabling more productive and contextually-aware coding assistance.

### Problem Statement
Developers currently spend significant time explaining their project context to AI coding assistants. Claude Code, while powerful, lacks automatic understanding of project structure, technology stack, dependencies, and recent development activity. This creates friction in the development workflow and reduces the effectiveness of AI assistance.

### Solution Overview
We're building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that automatically analyzes projects and provides structured context to Claude Code. This server acts as an intelligent intermediary that understands project characteristics and communicates them effectively to Claude through standardized MCP interfaces.

### Key Success Metrics
- **Developer Productivity**: 40% reduction in time spent explaining project context to Claude Code
- **Adoption Rate**: 10,000+ active installations within 6 months of release
- **Community Engagement**: 500+ GitHub stars and 50+ contributors within first year
- **Integration Quality**: Sub-200ms response time for context queries
- **Open Source Health**: Monthly releases with community-driven feature development

## Technical Architecture

### Core Architecture Principles

**Modularity**: The system consists of independent, well-defined modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. Each module handles a specific aspect of project analysis, from dependency parsing to Git integration.

**Extensibility**: The architecture supports plugin-based extensions, allowing the community to add support for new project types, dependency managers, and analysis capabilities without modifying core functionality.

**Performance**: Efficient caching strategies and incremental analysis ensure the server responds quickly to Claude Code requests, even for large projects with complex dependency graphs.

**Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling ensures the server continues providing useful context even when some analysis components encounter issues with unusual project structures.

### System Components

#### MCP Protocol Layer
The foundation layer that implements the Model Context Protocol specification. This component handles all communication with Claude Code, translating between MCP messages and internal project context data structures.

**Resources Implementation**: Exposes project context as readable resources that Claude Code can access directly. Resources include dependency graphs, project structure maps, and development activity summaries.

**Tools Implementation**: Provides callable functions that Claude Code can invoke for specific analysis tasks. Tools include dependency analysis, recent change detection, and project structure navigation.

**Prompts Implementation**: Offers pre-built context templates that help Claude Code understand how to work effectively with different project types and architectural patterns.

#### Project Analysis Engine
The core intelligence component that scans, analyzes, and interprets project characteristics. This engine coordinates multiple specialized analyzers to build comprehensive project understanding.

**File System Scanner**: Efficiently traverses project directories, identifying key files and folder structures while respecting common ignore patterns and performance constraints.

**Technology Detection Module**: Analyzes file extensions, configuration files, and project artifacts to identify programming languages, frameworks, build tools, and development environments.

**Dependency Analyzer**: Parses various dependency management files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.) to understand project dependencies, their versions, and update status.

**Git Integration Component**: Interfaces with Git repositories to extract recent commit history, branch information, and change patterns that provide insight into current development activity.

#### Context Data Management
Manages the storage, caching, and retrieval of analyzed project context. This component ensures efficient data access while maintaining context freshness and accuracy.

**Intelligent Caching System**: Implements multi-level caching strategies that balance performance with data freshness. The system tracks file modification times and Git commit hashes to invalidate stale cache entries.

**Data Serialization Layer**: Handles the conversion between internal data structures and MCP protocol formats, ensuring efficient and reliable communication with Claude Code.

**Configuration Management**: Manages server settings, project-specific customizations, and user preferences while maintaining sensible defaults for common project patterns.

### Technology Stack

#### Primary Implementation
**Runtime Environment**: Node.js v18+ for excellent MCP SDK support, robust file system operations, and extensive ecosystem compatibility.

**Programming Language**: TypeScript for strong typing, better developer experience, and improved maintainability. TypeScript ensures type safety across the complex data structures involved in project analysis.

**MCP Integration**: Official Anthropic MCP SDK for TypeScript, providing standardized protocol implementation and future compatibility with MCP evolution.

**Version Control**: Git integration through `simple-git` library for reliable and cross-platform Git operations without external dependencies.

#### Supporting Libraries
**File System Operations**: Native Node.js `fs` module with `fs-extra` for enhanced functionality and promise-based operations.

**Configuration Parsing**: `js-yaml` for YAML configuration files, built-in JSON support for package manifests, and `xml2js` for XML-based configuration parsing.

**Performance Optimization**: `lru-cache` for intelligent caching, `fast-glob` for efficient file pattern matching, and `worker_threads` for CPU-intensive analysis tasks.

**Testing Infrastructure**: Jest for unit and integration testing, `@types/jest` for TypeScript support, and `ts-jest` for seamless TypeScript test execution.

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Context Gathering Flow
When Claude Code requests project context, the server initiates a coordinated analysis sequence. The File System Scanner identifies project boundaries and key files. The Technology Detection Module analyzes these files to understand the project's technological profile. The Dependency Analyzer processes relevant configuration files to map the project's external dependencies. The Git Integration Component extracts recent development activity and change patterns.

#### MCP Communication Flow
The MCP Protocol Layer receives requests from Claude Code and routes them to appropriate analysis components. Results are aggregated, formatted according to MCP specifications, and returned to Claude Code. The system maintains connection state and supports both synchronous and asynchronous interaction patterns.

#### Caching Strategy
The caching system operates on multiple levels to optimize performance. File-level caching stores individual analysis results tied to file modification timestamps. Project-level caching maintains aggregate context data linked to Git commit hashes. Session-level caching keeps frequently accessed data in memory during active Claude Code sessions.
