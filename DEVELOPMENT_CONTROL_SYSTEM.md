# Development Control System

## Command: "start with the story"

When this command is triggered, Claude will execute the following automated workflow:

### 1. Story Selection Process

```markdown
1. Read STORY_TRACKING.md
2. Find the last completed story in the current epic
3. Identify the next story in sequence
4. If current epic is complete, move to next epic
5. Display selected story information
```

### 2. Task Breakdown

The selected story will be automatically broken down into implementation tasks:

```markdown
For each story:
1. Analyze the story description and acceptance criteria
2. Create 3-7 specific implementation tasks
3. Add tasks to todo list with unique IDs
4. Set first task to "in_progress"
```

### 3. Development Loop

For each task:
```markdown
1. Implement the specific functionality
2. Write/update tests (when applicable)
3. Update documentation (when applicable)
4. Commit with proper message format
5. Bump patch version
6. Mark task as completed
7. Move to next task
```

### 4. Story Completion

When all tasks are complete:
```markdown
1. Run comprehensive tests (when available)
2. Create story completion report
3. Make final commit with story summary
4. Bump minor version (or patch for fixes)
5. Create git tag
6. Update STORY_TRACKING.md
7. Move to next story
```
