## Implementation Details

### Key Features Implemented

1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive workflow with multi-Node.js version testing
   (18.x, 20.x)
2. **Automated Quality Checks**: TypeScript compilation, ESLint, Prettier formatting validation
3. **Test Coverage Integration**: Codecov integration with coverage reporting and thresholds
4. **Build Automation**: TypeScript compilation with artifact storage and retention
5. **Semantic Release System**: Automated version management based on conventional commits
6. **Manual Version Tools**: Scripts for controlled version bumping with quality checks

### Technical Decisions

- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions for seamless integration with repository
- **Testing Strategy**: Multi-version Node.js testing (18.x, 20.x) for compatibility
- **Release Process**: Semantic versioning with conventional commit message parsing
- **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov integration with 80% threshold enforcement
- **Artifact Management**: 30-day retention for build artifacts and automated distribution

## Version History

| Version | Type  | Description                                |
| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0.4.1   | Patch | GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline setup        |
| 0.4.2   | Patch | Semantic versioning and release automation |
| 0.5.0   | Minor | Story completion - CI/CD pipeline setup    |

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem**: YAML syntax error with duplicate `env` keys in GitHub Actions workflow **Solution**:
Consolidated environment variables into single `env` block with proper YAML structure

### Challenge 2

**Problem**: Commitlint requiring conventional commit format for automated releases **Solution**:
Updated commit messages to follow conventional commit specification (feat:, fix:, chore:)

### Challenge 3

**Problem**: Complex semantic versioning logic for automated releases **Solution**: Implemented
commit message parsing with fallback logic and manual version management options

## Lessons Learned

1. GitHub Actions requires precise YAML syntax - duplicate keys cause workflow failures
2. Semantic versioning automation benefits from conventional commit message standards
3. Multi-version testing catches compatibility issues early in development
4. Automated release processes require careful error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Dependencies Affected

## Notes

This story successfully establishes a professional-grade CI/CD pipeline that will support reliable,
automated development workflows throughout the project lifecycle. The comprehensive setup includes
automated testing, quality assurance, build processes, and both automated and manual release
management capabilities. The infrastructure is ready to support the implementation of core MCP
functionality in subsequent stories.

The pipeline provides flexibility with both automated semantic releases for regular development and
manual version management for controlled releases, ensuring the project can adapt to different
development scenarios and requirements.
