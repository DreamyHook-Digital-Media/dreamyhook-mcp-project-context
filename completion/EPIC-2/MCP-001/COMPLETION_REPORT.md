## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem**: MCP SDK module resolution issues with Jest testing framework **Solution**: Created
comprehensive mocks for MCP SDK modules to enable testing while maintaining interface compatibility

### Challenge 2

**Problem**: Environment variable configuration precedence in ServerConfig **Solution**: Implemented
proper undefined checking to allow default values when environment variables are not set

### Challenge 3

**Problem**: Error handling compatibility between custom errors and MCP protocol requirements
**Solution**: Created middleware system that transforms custom errors into MCP-compatible error
messages

## Lessons Learned

1. MCP SDK requires careful module mocking for testing due to ES module structure
2. Configuration systems benefit from explicit undefined checking for environment variables
3. Middleware architecture provides excellent separation of concerns for protocol handling
4. Request tracing significantly improves debugging and monitoring capabilities
