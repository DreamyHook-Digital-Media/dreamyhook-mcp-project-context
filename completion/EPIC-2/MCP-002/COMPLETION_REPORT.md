## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem**: Designing a flexible resource schema that can handle various project types and
structures **Solution**: Created modular TypeScript interfaces with optional fields and extensible
design patterns

### Challenge 2

**Problem**: Balancing performance with comprehensive project analysis for large codebases
**Solution**: Implemented intelligent filtering to skip build directories and set reasonable file
size limits

### Challenge 3

## Notes

This story successfully establishes a comprehensive resource interface system that provides
intelligent project context analysis through the MCP protocol. The implementation supports four main
resource types that cover the essential aspects of project understanding: metadata, structure,
dependencies, and file content access.

The modular architecture ensures that the resource system can be easily extended with additional
analysis capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility. The comprehensive error handling and
security measures provide a robust foundation for safe project analysis in various environments.

The resource interface serves as a critical component that enables Claude Code to automatically
understand project context without manual explanation, significantly reducing the cognitive overhead
for developers when working with AI coding assistants.
